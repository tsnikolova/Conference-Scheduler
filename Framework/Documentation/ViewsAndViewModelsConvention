Views and ViewModels should follow the same namespace structure as Controllers and
Binding Models.

Example:
If the controller is in Admin/IndexController
Then the views for that controller should be in Admin/IndexController/{Method}
Then the viewModels for that controller should be in Admin/IndexController/{Method}ViewModel

Layouts should be in Layouts, but the structure is up to the programmer.
Partials can be put anywhere, as long as the proper path is given in the api.
Errors must be in 'Errors' with name - the error code.
